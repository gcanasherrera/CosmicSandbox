# CosmicSandbox 🚀
A playful playground for experimenting with Large-Scale Structure and cosmology — random notebooks, tests, and ideas 🪐🧪

## What this repo contains 📚
Collection of experimental Jupyter notebooks for exploring large‑scale structure and cosmology. Notebooks are intended as scratchpads for analyses, visualizations, and small code experiments 

## Where to find notebooks 🔎
- Look in the top-level `notebooks/` directory 
- Each notebook should include a short header describing its purpose and any inputs required 

## Recommended workflow ✅
- Keep runnable cells near the top that set up imports and parameters 
- Store heavy data externally and include download/prepare steps in a separate utility or a dataprep notebook 
- Use clear titles and tags to indicate experiment status (e.g., draft, test, final) 

## Contributing 🤝
- Add notebooks under `notebooks/` with descriptive filenames 
- Prefer small, focused notebooks over monolithic experiments   
- Open issues for reproducibility gaps or missing dependencies 

## Notes 📝
- Treat this repo as an experimental sandbox — contents may be deleted or refactored frequently 
- If you want stable results, extract analysis code into scripts or modules and add tests
